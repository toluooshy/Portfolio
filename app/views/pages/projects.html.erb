<h5><mark><a href="http://www.wobblefinance.com/"> Wobble Finance</a></mark></h5>
<p style="text-size: large; padding-left: 15%; padding-right: 15%;">
Wobble Finance is a bare-bones cryptocurrency screener that allows the user to look
up hundreds of different cryptocurrencies and see how they are performing. Simply
search for any major cryptocurrency symbol and in seconds get the bread-and-butter
statistics about it, including the current price, the 24-hour price change, and the
total exchange volume in USD. Wobble Finance was created to help those new to the
cryptocurrency space learn more about cryptocurrencies through educational videos
and then apply what they have learned with the aid of the Wobble Finance screener
web app. In addition to this there is the Wobble Finance Token (WBBL) that helps
fund API calls for the web app. The Wobble Finance Token (WBBL) is available to trade
on the Binance Smart Chain as a BEP-20 token and is a listed asset on PancakeSwap.

<h5><mark><a href="https://hipstertrek.herokuapp.com/"> HipsterTrek</a></mark></h5>
<p style="text-size: large; padding-left: 15%; padding-right: 15%;">
Over the past few decades we have seen the global music industry evolve at continuously
increasing rates, and with this phenomenon comes the advent of music becoming more
accessible to individuals overall. Just like how no two people share the exact same
character traits, our music tastes vary from person to person as well. This notion had
me thinking about different major music genres and how it could be possible to find
similarities between them and create a basic graphical representation. In the process
of creating this map one question began to rise in my mind: could it be possible to
create an algorithm that would offer the shortest path to go from one music genre to
another? This became the basis for my implementation project.

<h5><mark><a href="https://toluooshy.github.io/SoftSysDynamiChat/"> DynamiChat</a></mark></h5>
<p style="text-size: large; padding-left: 15%; padding-right: 15%;">
The ultimate goal of DynamiChat is to serve as a messaging platform that can be accessed
simply from the user’s terminal with an internet connection, allowing for a more streamlined
and simplistic medium of communication. Starting with internet communications, a MongoDB Atlas
cluster was set up to hold the data from messages sent and received, and DyanmiChat would
communicate with this database using GET and POST requests written in C with the MongoDB C Driver.

This project was designed to be a "virtual closet" where the user can log any 
clothing attire they might have hat they would like to try something new with; 
all the while promoting sustainable/ethical clothing brands. Currently this 
project is under redesign to allow the user to log in (previously this was 
an offline webapp).

<h5><mark><a href="http://thesbpro.org/"> The Storyboard Project</a></mark></h5>
<p style="text-size: large; padding-left: 15%; padding-right: 15%;">
This project was designed to be a "coming-of-age" platform for young adults to 
semi-anonymously submit vignettes from their childhoods through adolescence. This 
was developed in hopes of spurring conversation around overlooked conversations 
that could be had, and can be used by parents to better understand what their 
children may be going through from the mouth of another youth.

This Python game is a modern adaptation of the classic SEGA game ‘Outrun’, 
with a remix to the original game play where you can choose between three 
different cars and race along 6 different courses. It was developed as my
