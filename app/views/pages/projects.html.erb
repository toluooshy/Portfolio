This project was designed to be a "virtual closet" where the user can log any 
clothing attire they might have hat they would like to try something new with; 
all the while promoting sustainable/ethical clothing brands. Currently this 
project is under redesign to allow the user to log in (previously this was 
an offline webapp).

<h5><mark><a href="http://thesbpro.org/"> The Storyboard Project</a></mark></h5>
<p style="text-size: large; padding-left: 15%; padding-right: 15%;">
This project was designed to be a "coming-of-age" platform for young adults to 
semi-anonymously submit vignettes from their childhoods through adolescence. This 
was developed in hopes of spurring conversation around overlooked conversations 
that could be had, and can be used by parents to better understand what their 
children may be going through from the mouth of another youth.

This Python game is a modern adaptation of the classic SEGA game ‘Outrun’, 
with a remix to the original game play where you can choose between three 
different cars and race along 6 different courses. It was developed as my  
final project for my Software Design class at Olin.
