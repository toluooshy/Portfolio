<h4>Synopsis:</h4>
<p style="text-size: large; padding-left: 30%; padding-right: 30%;">
Ever since I was little, I was obsessed with learning, and throughout my life,
I have developed a strong set of technical skills that have matched my drive to
always learn. For example, I thought myself Java in 7th grade, and since then I
have also become proficient in C# and JavaScript; languages that I have used to
develop mobile apps. I am currently a student at Olin College of Engineering
majoring in Computer and Electrical Engineering.
<br/>
<br/>
Keeping in step with my desire for knowledge, I have also coupled the concepts
that I learned during my first year at Olin in Python to teach myself Django web
development, Rails web development, and the MERN stack—among other new skills
like utilizing Google Cloud, Heroku, and Azure.
<br/>
<br/>
From my second year I was able to delve deeper into the logic and structures of
computing, using tools like Verilog, C and various build environments along the
way. Additionally I took the time to self study blockchain technology and
recently released my own cryptocurrency.
