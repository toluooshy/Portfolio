Hi! My name is Tolulope Oshinowo and I am currently a sophomore at Olin College of Engineering planning to major in Electrical & Computer Engineering. I have a passion for coputing and robotics, and I am especially interested in the application of technologies with the potential in increase the quality of life. I enjoy examining the features of Human Computer Interactions that lie within politics and the economy, as I love a good conversation concerning government and markets.  In my free time I enjoy producing music, sketching out ideas for future projects, and watching—or participating in sporting.
